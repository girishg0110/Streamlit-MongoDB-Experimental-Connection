# Streamlit MongoDB Experimental Connection

Streamlit is a convenient way to deploy data scripts as accessible web apps in minutes. This project is a submission to the 2023 Experimental Connections Hackathon. 

It consists of 
* connection.py: a functional st.experimental_connection implementation for MongoDB usage in Streamlit, and
* test_mongo.py: a Streamlit app that allows users to query a MongoDB database that backs Seed Swap, my winning submission to MLH's NeighborhoodHacks 2023.
